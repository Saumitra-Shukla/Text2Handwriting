# Text2Handwriting
Initially based on @SaiTeja69 's [Assignment Writer](https://github.com/SaiTeja69/Assignment_Writer)

I've modified it extensively and added some more features

NOTE: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT, MANY BUGS MAY BE THERE. Feel free to contribute.

## Features
- Real like handwriting
- 3 default handwritings
- ability to train/add custom handwritings
- ability to add custom page type
- File based TokenManagement system to prevent misuse
- Everything is done in browser itself, no backend power required.

## TODO
 - Ability to Download as PDF
 - Add support for more wide range of characters
 - If time and boredom allows, add a User system and document management system as well.
